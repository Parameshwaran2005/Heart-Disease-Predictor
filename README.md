❤️ Heart Disease Predictor

📌 Overview
The Heart Disease Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on their medical attributes. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze health data and provide a prediction that can assist medical professionals in early-stage diagnosis.

This project is implemented in Python within a Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook and utilizes core data science and machine learning libraries for model training, evaluation, and persistence.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the UCI Heart Disease dataset for training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand data patterns.

Model Training: Implements classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Performance Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Model Persistence: Exports the trained model as a .pkl file for future use.

User-Friendly Notebook: A well-documented notebook for easy execution and understanding.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NumPy & Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.

▶️ Usage
Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.

Run the Cells:

Execute the cells in the Heart_Disease_Predictor.ipynb notebook sequentially.

The notebook will guide you through loading data, training the model, and seeing the predictions.

Use the Saved Model:

The trained model is saved in the models/ directory, which can be loaded into other applications for making live predictions.

📊 Example Workflow
Load Dataset: Import the heart.csv dataset using Pandas.

Preprocess Data: Clean the data and perform feature scaling.

Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets.

Train ML Model: Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression) on the training data.

Evaluate Performance: Check the model's accuracy score and confusion matrix on the test data.

Save Model: Serialize the trained model to a .pkl file for later use.

🔮 Future Improvements
Build a Web App: Develop a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit or Flask.

Expand Dataset: Incorporate a larger, more diverse dataset to improve generalization.

Try Advanced Models: Experiment with ensemble methods like XGBoost or simple Neural Networks.

Cloud Deployment: Deploy the final application on a cloud service like Heroku or AWS.
